# Spam Classification Project

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project for classifying spam messages. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to accurately differentiate between spam and non-spam messages. 

## Project Overview

The project includes end-to-end steps for developing a robust spam classifier:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for model input.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using NLP techniques to transform text into features.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and training various machine learning models.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with relevant metrics.

## Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Techniques for cleaning and vectorizing text.
- **Modeling with Multiple Algorithms**: Comparison of multiple models to find the best classifier.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics to evaluate and visualize model accuracy and efficiency.
- **Data Visualization**: Insightful plots to aid data understanding and model analysis.

## Use Cases

This project can benefit researchers, developers, and machine learning enthusiasts who want to:
- Build and understand spam detection models for email, SMS, and social media applications.
- Learn about applying NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms in text classification tasks.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
